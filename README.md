# Linear Algebra Calculator
This is a project I created as a web application to help students in linear algebra solve and check numerous math problems 
while studying. The web link to the site is www.linearalgebraplus.com. The software can perform the following operations on matrices of up to 20 dimensions
  * Determinant of a square matrix
  * Matrix multiplication of two matrices
  * Row reduced echelon form of a matrix
  * Inverse of a square matrix

In designing this web application, I used python and the flask library as the backend of my application script, with html/css design for the user interface. In order to change my html according to user selections, I used React.js to make my website work dynamically.

The purpose of my project was to create a simple software where students can quickly enter and modify matrices and get quick results. I also wanted to learn more about python's mathematical functions, flask, and how to build a dynamic web application in the process. I used www.heroku.com to deploy my website with heroku's command line tools. I really enjoyed working on this project as it helped me develop my software skills and build a software which others can use at the same time.
